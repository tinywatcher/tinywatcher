# Example configuration demonstrating glob pattern support for file monitoring
#
# Glob patterns allow you to watch multiple files matching a pattern without
# listing each file individually. This is especially useful for:
# - Rotating logs (e.g., app-2024-12-01.log, app-2024-12-02.log)
# - Multiple log files in a directory (e.g., error.log, access.log)
# - Logs from multiple services (e.g., /var/log/services/*/error.log)

identity:
  name: "glob-example-server"

inputs:
  # Watch all .log files in the current directory
  files:
    - "*.log"
    
    # Watch all log files in a specific directory
    # - "/var/log/myapp/*.log"
    
    # Watch error logs from all services
    # - "/var/log/services/*/error.log"
    
    # Watch all access logs recursively (use ** for recursive)
    # - "/var/log/**/access.log"
    
    # Watch today's rotating log file
    # - "/var/log/app-*.log"

alerts:
  stdout:
    type: stdout

rules:
  - name: "error-detected"
    text: "ERROR"
    alert: stdout
